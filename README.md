# minnie-janus

A small, modern, transparent JavaScript interface for the [Janus WebRTC gateway API](https://janus.conf.meetecho.com/docs/rest.html), for browsers as well as Node.js.

Inspiration came from the project [minijanus](https://github.com/mozilla/minijanus.js) (hence this name, 'minnie-janus'), but this is a rewrite from scratch because I needed ES6 modules, events, better logging, and a fix of one small (API issue)[https://github.com/mozilla/minijanus.js/issues/3] in minijanus.

Provided are two behavior implementations, `Session` (see [src/session.js](src/session.js)) and `BasePlugin` (see [src/base-plugin.js](src/base-plugin.js)), which transparently map to their server-side equivalents.

`BasePlugin` is supposed to be extended with per-plugin logic before being attached to a `Session` instance, because Janus plugins are more like applications with very specific behavior.

Neither `Session` nor `BasePlugin` instances actually communicate with janus-gateway. The parent application instantiating a `Session` is responsible for wiring up the transport of choice (REST HTTP(S), (Secure) WebSockets, etc.) to the `Session.receive()` method and the `Session#output` event.

Usage of mini-janus is best illustrated by the full demo/example implementing the 'echotest' plugin (included in Janus' source code). It can be found in the [demo](demo) subdirectory (see also [demo/README.md](demo/README.md) there).

Source code is documented.

If your environment is not yet ready for ES6 modules, use `dist/session.js` and `dist/base-plugin.js` and their source maps instead. These distribution files can be regenerated by running

    npm install
    jspm install
    gulp build
