# minnie-janus

![Test badge](https://github.com/michaelfranzl/minnie-janus/workflows/Test/badge.svg)

A small, modern, general interface module written in ES8 Javascript for the [Janus WebRTC gateway
API](https://janus.conf.meetecho.com/docs/rest.html), for browsers as well as Node.js.

Inspiration came from the project [minijanus](https://github.com/mozilla/minijanus.js) (hence this
name, 'minnie-janus'), but this is a rewrite from scratch because I needed ES modules, events,
async/await syntax, better logging, and a fix of one small (API
issue)[https://github.com/mozilla/minijanus.js/issues/3] in minijanus.

Provided are two behavior implementations, `Session` (see [src/session.js](src/session.js)) and
`BasePlugin` (see [src/base-plugin.js](src/base-plugin.js)), which transparently map to their
server-side equivalents.

`BasePlugin` is supposed to be extended with per-plugin logic before being attached to a `Session`
instance, because Janus plugins are more like applications with very specific behavior. See
examples below on how to extend the `BasePlugin` implementation.

Neither `Session` nor `BasePlugin` instances actually communicate with janus-gateway. The parent
application instantiating a `Session` is responsible for wiring up the transport of choice (REST
HTTP(S), (Secure) WebSockets, etc.) to the `Session.receive()` method and the `Session#output`
event.

Usage of mini-janus is best illustrated by the full demo/example implementing the 'echotest' plugin
(included in Janus' source code). It can be found in the [demo](demo) subdirectory (see also
[demo/README.md](demo/README.md) there).

The implementation has been manually tested and confirmed working with janus-gateway version tag
0.7.4.

Source code is documented.


## How to extend BasePlugin

The 'echotest' [demo](demo) contained in this repository extends `BasePlugin` with so-called
"Stamps", but this section gives you examples of different ways.

### Using "Stamps"

Read about "Stamps" here:

https://medium.com/@koresar/fun-with-stamps-episode-1-stamp-basics-e0627d81efe0
https://www.npmjs.com/package/@stamp/it

The following will export a factory function (invokable with or without the `new` keyword).

```javascript
import BasePlugin from '../src/base-plugin-stamp.js';

const factory = BasePlugin.compose({
  methods, // your own methods
  properties, // your own properties
  initializers: [init], // your own initializer(s)
});
export default factory;
```


### Using a factory function

If you prefer to use a factory function in your parent app (invokable without the `new` keyword),
here is how you would extend `BasePlugin` using plain-object OOP:

```javascript
import base_plugin from '../src/base-plugin.js';

let factory = function(...args) {
  let prototype = Object.assign(
    {},
    base_plugin.properties,
    base_plugin.methods,
    methods, // your own methods
    properties, // your own properties
  );
  let instance = Object.create(prototype);

  base_plugin.init.call(instance, ...args); // equivalent to super(...args)
  init.call(instance, ...args);

  return instance;
};
export default factory;
```


### Using instantiation

If you prefer to use the `new` keyword, here is how you would extend `BasePlugin`:

```javascript
import base_plugin from '../src/base-plugin.js';

function EchotestPlugin(...args) {
  base_plugin.init.call(this, ...args);
  init.call(this, ...args);
}

Object.assign(EchotestPlugin.prototype, base_plugin.properties);
Object.assign(EchotestPlugin.prototype, base_plugin.methods);
Object.assign(EchotestPlugin.prototype, methods); // your own methods
Object.assign(EchotestPlugin.prototype, properties); // your own properties

export default EchotestPlugin;
```


### Using classes

If you prefer to use a class to extend `BasePlugin`:

```javascript
import base_plugin from '../src/base-plugin.js';

function BasePlugin(...args) {
  base_plugin.init.call(this, ...args);
}

Object.assign(BasePlugin.prototype, base_plugin.properties);
Object.assign(BasePlugin.prototype, base_plugin.methods);

class EchotestPlugin extends BasePlugin {
  constructor(...args) {
    super(...args);
    init.call(this, ...args);
  }
}

Object.assign(EchotestPlugin.prototype, properties); // your own properties
Object.assign(EchotestPlugin.prototype, methods); // your own methods

export default EchotestPlugin;
```
