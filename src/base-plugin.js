/**
 * The base behavior of a plugin: Attach/detach and send/receive
 * messages to/from the server-side plugin.
 * 
 * This behavior is supposed to be 'subclassed', and some of the methods
 * overridden, because every janus plugin is different.
 * 
 * This is intentionally not implemented as a class or a function
 * (constructor-prototype combination) . Rather, properties, methods and an
 * initializer/constructor are exported explicitly as plain objects for maximum
 * flexibility regarding different JS ways of
 * inheriting/subclassing/extending/mixing.
